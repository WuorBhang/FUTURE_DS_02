# Social Media Sentiment Analysis ‚Äì Task 1

## Overview

This project analyzes social media sentiment using both Jupyter Notebook for preprocessing and Power BI for data visualization. It is part of the **Future Interns Data Science Program**. The goal is to extract valuable insights from public sentiment on social media platforms, identify key trends, and visualize the results through interactive dashboards.

## Project Structure

- **Jupyter Notebook**: Contains the preprocessing steps, including data cleaning, tokenization, sentiment analysis, and preparing the dataset for visualization in Power BI.
- **Power BI Reports**: Visualizations to track sentiment trends, display the sentiment distribution, highlight top positive and negative comments, and identify frequently mentioned words through a word cloud.
- **GitHub Repository**: Contains all code, visualizations, and resources for the project.

## Key Insights

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Sentiment Distribution Pie Chart üç∞
The **Sentiment Distribution Pie Chart** visualizes the overall sentiment breakdown of social media posts. This chart provides the percentage of **positive**, **neutral**, and **negative** reviews.
